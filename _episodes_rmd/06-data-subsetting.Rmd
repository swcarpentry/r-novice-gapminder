R has many powerful subset operators. Mastering them will allow you to
easily perform complex operations on any kind of dataset.

There are six different ways we can subset any kind of object, and three
different subsetting operators for the different data structures.

Let's start with the workhorse of R: a simple numeric vector.

```{r}
x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
x
```

> In R, simple vectors containing character strings, numbers, or logical values are called *atomic* vectors because they can't be further simplified.
{: .callout}

So now that we've created a dummy vector to play with, how do we get at its
contents?

## Accessing elements using their indices

To extract elements of a vector we can give their corresponding index, starting
from one:

```{r}
x[1]
```

```{r}
x[4]
```

It may look different, but the square brackets operator is a function. For vectors
(and matrices), it means "get me the nth element".

We can ask for multiple elements at once:

```{r}
x[c(1, 3)]
```

Or slices of the vector:

```{r}
x[1:4]
```

the `:` operator creates a sequence of numbers from the left element to the right.
```{r}
1:4
c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```


We can ask for the same element multiple times:

```{r}
x[c(1,1,3)]
```

If we ask for an index beyond the length of the vector, R will return a missing value:
```{r}
x[6]
```

This is a vector of length one containing an `NA`, whose name is also `NA`.

If we ask for the 0th element, we get an empty vector:

```{r}
x[0]
```

> ## Vector numbering in R starts at 1
>
> In many programming languages (C and Python, for example), the first
> element of a vector has an index of 0. In R, the first element is 1.
{: .callout}

## Skipping and removing elements

If we use a negative number as the index of a vector, R will return
every element *except* for the one specified:

```{r}
x[-2]
```

We can skip multiple elements:

```{r}
x[c(-1, -5)]  # or x[-c(1,5)]
```

> ## Tip: Order of operations

> A common trip up for novices occurs when trying to skip
> slices of a vector. It's natural to to try to negate a

>

>
> The correct solution is to wrap that function call in brackets, so
> that the `-` operator applies to the result:
>
> ```{r}
> x[-(1:3)]
> ```
{: .callout}


To remove elements from a vector, we need to assign the result back
into the variable:

```{r}
x <- x[-4]
x
```

## Subsetting by name

We can extract elements by using their name, instead of extracting by index:

```{r}
x <- c(a=5.4, b=6.2, c=7.1, d=4.8, e=7.5) # we can name a vector 'on the fly'
x[c("a", "c")]
```

This is usually a much more reliable way to subset objects: the
position of various elements can often change when chaining together
subsetting operations, but the names will always remain the same!

## Subsetting through other logical operations

We can also use any logical vector to subset:

```{r}
x[c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

Since comparison operators (e.g. `>`, `<`, `==`) evaluate to logical vectors, we can also
use them to succinctly subset vectors: the following statement gives
the same result as the previous one.

```{r}
x[x > 7]
```

Breaking it down, this statement first evaluates `x>7`, generating
a logical vector `c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)`, and then
selects the elements of `x` corresponding to the `TRUE` values.

We can use `==` to mimic the previous method of indexing by name
(remember you have to use `==` rather than `=` for comparisons):

```{r}
x[names(x) == "a"]
```

>  * `|`, the "logical OR" operator: returns `TRUE`, if either the left or right

>
> You may sometimes see `&&` and `||` instead of `&` and `|`. These two-character operators

> for programming, i.e. deciding whether to execute a statement.
>
>  * `!`, the "logical NOT" operator: converts `TRUE` to `FALSE` and `FALSE` to
>    `TRUE`. It can negate a single logical condition (eg `!TRUE` becomes
>    `FALSE`), or a whole vector of conditions(eg `!c(TRUE, FALSE)` becomes
>    `c(FALSE, TRUE)`).
>
> Additionally, you can compare the elements within a single vector using the

## Skipping named elements

Skipping or removing named elements is a little harder. If we try to skip one named element by negating the string, R complains (slightly obscurely) that it doesn't know how to take the negative of a string:

```{r}
x <- c(a=5.4, b=6.2, c=7.1, d=4.8, e=7.5) # we start again by naming a vector 'on the fly'
x[-"a"]
```

However, we can use the `!=` (not-equals) operator to construct a logical vector that will do what we want:

```{r}
x[names(x) != "a"]
```

Skipping multiple named indices is a little bit harder still. Suppose we want to drop the `"a"` and `"c"` elements, so we try this:

```{r}
x[names(x)!=c("a","c")]
```

R did *something*, but it gave us a warning that we ought to pay attention to - and it apparently *gave us the wrong answer* (the `"c"` element is still included in the vector)!

So what does `!=` actually do in this case? That's an excellent question.

### Recycling

Let's take a look at the comparison component of this code:

```{r}
names(x) != c("a", "c")
```

Why does R give `FALSE` as the third element of this vector, when `names(x)[3] != "c"` is obviously false?
When you use `!=`, R tries to compare each element
of the left argument with the corresponding element of its right
argument. What happens when you compare vectors of different lengths?

![Inequality testing](../fig/06-rmd-inequality.1.png)

When one vector is shorter than the other, it gets *recycled*:

![Inequality testing: results of recycling](../fig/06-rmd-inequality.2.png)

In this case R **repeats** `c("a", "c")` as many times as necessary to match `names(x)`, i.e. we get `c("a","c","a","c","a")`. Since the recycled `"a"`
doesn't match the third element of `names(x)`, the value of `!=` is `FALSE`.
Because in this case the longer vector length (5) isn't a multiple of the shorter vector length (2), R printed a warning message. If we had been unlucky and `names(x)` had contained six elements, R would *silently* have done the wrong thing (i.e., not what we intended it to do). This recycling rule can can introduce hard-to-find and subtle bugs!

The way to get R to do what we really want (match *each* element of the left argument with *all* of the elements of the right argument) it to use the `%in%` operator. The `%in%` operator goes through each element of its left argument, in this case the names of `x`, and asks, "Does this element occur in the second argument?". Here, since we want to *exclude* values, we also need a `!` operator to change "in" to "not in":

```{r}
x[! names(x) %in% c("a","c") ]
```

## Handling special values

At some point you will encounter functions in R that cannot handle missing, infinite,
or undefined data.

There are a number of special functions you can use to filter out this data:

 * `is.na` will return all positions in a vector, matrix, or data.frame
   containing `NA` (or `NaN`)
 * likewise, `is.nan`, and `is.infinite` will do the same for `NaN` and `Inf`.
 * `is.finite` will return all positions in a vector, matrix, or data.frame
   that do not contain `NA`, `NaN` or `Inf`.
 * `na.omit` will filter out all missing values from a vector

## Factor subsetting

Now that we've explored the different ways to subset vectors, how
do we subset the other data structures?

Factor subsetting works the same way as vector subsetting.

```{r}
f <- factor(c("a", "a", "b", "c", "c", "d"))
f[f == "a"]
f[f %in% c("b", "c")]
f[1:3]
```

Skipping elements will not remove the level
even if no more of that category exists in the factor:

```{r}
f[-3]
```



## List subsetting

Now we'll introduce some new subsetting operators. There are three functions
used to subset lists. We've already seen these when learning about atomic vectors and matrices:  `[`, `[[`, and `$`.

Using `[` will always return a list. If you want to *subset* a list, but not
*extract* an element, then you will likely use `[`.

```{r}
xlist <- list(a = "Software Carpentry", b = 1:10, data = head(iris))
xlist[1]
```

This returns a *list with one element*.

We can subset elements of a list exactly the same way as atomic
vectors using `[`. Comparison operations however won't work as
they're not recursive, they will try to condition on the data structures
in each element of the list, not the individual elements within those
data structures.

```{r}
xlist[1:2]
```

To extract individual elements of a list, you need to use the double-square
bracket function: `[[`.

```{r}
xlist[[1]]
```

Notice that now the result is a vector, not a list.

You can't extract more than one element at once:

```{r, error=TRUE}
xlist[[1:2]]
```

Nor use it to skip elements:

```{r, error=TRUE}
xlist[[-1]]
```

But you can use names to both subset and extract elements:

```{r}
xlist[["a"]]
```

The `$` function is a shorthand way for extracting elements by name:

```{r}
xlist$data
```

{: .challenge}


## Data frames

Remember the data frames are lists underneath the hood, so similar rules
apply. However they are also two dimensional objects:

`[` with one argument will act the same way as for lists, where each list
element corresponds to a column. The resulting object will be a data frame:

```{r}
head(gapminder[3])
```

Similarly, `[[` will act to extract *a single column*:

```{r}
head(gapminder[["lifeExp"]])
```

And `$` provides a convenient shorthand to extract columns by name:

```{r}
head(gapminder$year)
```

With two arguments, `[` behaves the same way as for matrices:

```{r}
gapminder[1:3,]
```

If we subset a single row, the result will be a data frame (because
the elements are mixed types):

```{r}
gapminder[3,]
```

But for a single column the result will be a vector (this can
be changed with the third argument, `drop = FALSE`).
