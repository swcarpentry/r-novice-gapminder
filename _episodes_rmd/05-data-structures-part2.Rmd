```{r setup, include=FALSE}
source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
knitr_fig_path("05-")
```

```{r}
# Commenting because this should run only once per project, not per session
# Start with fresh environment; encourage a reproducible and defensive workflow
# install.packages("usethis")
# usethis::use_blank_slate("project")

# https://www.tidyverse.org
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

At this point, you've seen it all: in the last lesson, we toured all the basic
data types (i.e. their underlying `class()`) and data structures in R. Everything you do will be a manipulation of
those tools. But most of the time, the star of the show is the data frameâ€”the table that we created by loading information from a csv file. In this lesson, we'll learn a few more things
about working with data frames.

To work with data frame, the packages from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) are particularly well suited.

```{r}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

## Adding columns and rows in data frames

We already learned that the columns of a data frame are vectors, so that our
data are consistent in class throughout the columns.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cats <- read_csv("data/feline-data.csv")

# Note the class of each column
cats
```

Let's add a new column.

```{r}
age <- c(2, 3, 5)
add_column(cats, age)

# Same with the pipe (http://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html#introduction)
cats %>% add_column(age)
```

Note that if we tried to add a vector of ages with a different number of entries than the number of rows in the dataframe, it would fail:

```{r, error=TRUE}
too_long <- c(2, 3, 5, 12)
add_column(cats, age = too_long)

too_short <- c(2, 3)
add_column(cats, too_short)
```

Why didn't this work? Of course, R wants to see one element in our new column
for every row in the `cats` table. 

So for it to work we need to have `nrow(cats)` = `length(age)`. Let's overwite the content of cats with our new data frame.

```{r}
age <- c(2, 3, 5)
# Now using `mutate()` which is more general.
cats <- mutate(cats, age)

# Same with the pipe (to unserstand what is comming next)
cats <- cats %>% 
  mutate(age)

cats
```

Now how about adding rows?

```{r}
# Using the pipe to more clearly show interesting arguments of `add_row()`
cats <- cats %>% 
  add_row(
    coat = "tortoiseshell", 
    weight = 3.3, 
    likes_string = TRUE, 
    age = 9
  )
```

## Factors

Notice that `cats` has no factors. This is because we read its data with the defensive (as in defensive driving) `read_csv()` fucntion instead of the ackward `read.csv()` function.

Compare:

```{r}
cats1 <- read_csv("data/feline-data.csv")
str(cats1)
class(cats1$coat)

# Same
cats1.1 <- read.csv("data/feline-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
all.equal(cats1, cats1.1)

# Not the same
cats2 <- read.csv("data/feline-data.csv")
str(cats2)
all.equal(cats1, cats2)
class(cats2$coat)
```

Factors are something important to look out for: in a `factor`, each different value represents what is called a `level`. In our case, the `factor` "coat" has 3 levels: "black", "calico", and "tabby". R will only accept values that match one of the levels. If you add a new value, it will become `NA`.

```{r}
levels(cats2$coat)

# Reproduce what we did before with `cats`, now with `cats2`
cats3 <- cats2 %>%
  add_column(age = c(2, 3, 5)) %>% 
  add_row(
    coat = "tortoiseshell", 
    weight = 3.3, 
    # Note that `TRUE` is interpreted as `1`, and `FALSE` as `0`
    likes_string = TRUE, 
    age = 9
  )

levels(cats3$coat)
```

As soon as you note an unwanted factor in your data you should coerce it to the desired class.

```{r}
class(cats3$coat)

cats4 <- mutate(cats3, coat = as.character(coat))
class(cats4$coat)

# Same
cats3$coat <- as.character(cats3$coat)
cats4 <- cats3
class(cats4$coat)
```

> ## Challenge 1
> Let's imagine that 1 human year is equivalent to 7 cat years. 
> 1. Create a vector called `human.age` by multiplying `cats$age` by 7.
> 2. Convert `human.age` to a factor.
> 3. Convert `human.age` back to a numeric vector using the `as.numeric()` function. Now divide it by 7 to get the original ages back. Explain what happened.
>
> > ## Solution to Challenge 1
> > 1. `human.age <- cats$age * 7`
> > 2. `human.age <- factor(human.age)`. `as.factor(human.age)` works just as well.
> > 3. `as.numeric(human.age)` yields `1 2 3 4 4` because factors are stored as integers (here, 1:4), each of which is associated with a label (here, 28, 35, 56, and 63). Converting the factor to a numeric vector gives us the underlying integers, not the labels. If we want the original numbers, we need to convert `human.age` to a character vector and then to a numeric vector (why does this work?). This comes up in real life when we accidentally include a character somewhere in a column of a .csv file supposed to only contain numbers, and forget to set `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` when we read in the data.

## Removing rows and dealing with missing values

We now know how to add rows and columns to our data frame in R. Now let's see how you may remove rows. The most common case is to drop missing values.

```{r}
# Introducing missing values
cats_na <- cats %>% 
  add_row(
    coat = c("tortoiseshell", NA), 
    weight = c(NA, 3.3), 
    likes_string = c(TRUE, FALSE), 
    age = 9:10
  )
cats_na
```
```{r}
# Drop missing values
drop_na(cats_na)

# Filter by column
filter(cats_na, is.na(coat))
# The opposite
filter(cats_na, !is.na(coat))
```

Although its best to filtering data using expresisons (such as `is.na(cats_na$coat)`, you may want to filter by specific row numbers. This is a little ackward but important and common:

```{r}
# Remove 4th row
cats[-4, ]
```

```{r}
# Remove 4th and 5th rows
small1 <- cats[c(-4,-5), ]
small1

# Same
to_discard <- -c(4, 5)
small2 <- cats[to_discard, ]
identical(small1, small2)
```

## Removing columns  

We can also remove columns in our data frame. What if we want to remove the column `age`. 

```{r}
# With index
select(cats, -4)

# With name
select(cats, -age)
```

You can also use the `[]` syntax you learned above.

```{r}
# With index
cats[ , -4]

# With name
not_age <- setdiff(names(cats), "age")
not_age
cats[ , not_age]

# Same
not_age <- ! names(cats) %in% "age"
not_age
cats[ , not_age]
```

Notice the comma with nothing before it, indicating we want to keep all of the rows.

## Appending to a data frame

We can also glue two data frames together with `bind_rows()`:

```{r}
cats <- bind_rows(cats, cats)
cats
```

> ## Challenge 2
>
> You can create a new data frame right from within R with the following syntax:
> ```{r}
> library(tidyverse)
> 
> df <- tibble(
>   first ="Grace",
>   last = "Hopper",
>   lucky_number = 0
> )
> df
> ```
> Make a data frame that holds the following information for yourself:
>
> - first name
> - last name
> - lucky number
>
> Then use `add_row()` to add an entry for the people sitting beside you.
> Finally, use `add_column()` to add a column with each person's answer to the question, "Is it time for coffee break?" (Note the alternative with `tribble()`).
>
> > ## Solution to Challenge 2

## Realistic example

So far, you have seen the basics of manipulating data frames with our cat data;
now let's use those skills to digest a more realistic dataset. Let's read in the
`gapminder` dataset that we downloaded previously:

```{r}
gapminder <- read_csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
```

> ## Miscellaneous Tips
>
> * Another type of file you might encounter are tab-separated value files (.tsv). See `?read_delim()` and `?read_tsv()`.
>
> * Files can also be downloaded directly from the Internet into a local
> folder of your choice onto your computer using the `download.file` function.
> The `read.csv` function can then be executed to read the downloaded file from the download location, for example,
> ```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
> download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv", destfile = "data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
> gapminder <- read_csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
> ```
>
> * Alternatively, you can also read in files directly into R from the Internet by replacing the file paths with a web address in `read_csv`. One should note that in doing this no local copy of the csv file is first saved onto your computer. For example,
> ```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
> gapminder <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
> ```
>
> * You can read directly from excel spreadsheets without
> converting them to plain text first by using the [readxl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/index.html) package.

Let's investigate gapminder a bit; the first thing we should always do is check
out what the data looks like with `str`:

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

We can also examine individual columns of the data frame with our `typeof` function:

```{r}
typeof(gapminder$year)
typeof(gapminder$country)
str(gapminder$country)
```

We can also interrogate the data frame for information about its dimensions;
remembering that `str(gapminder)` said there were 1704 observations of 6
variables in gapminder, what do you think the following will produce, and why?

```{r}
length(gapminder)
```

A fair guess would have been to say that the length of a data frame would be the
number of rows it has (1704), but this is not the case; remember, a data frame
is a *list of vectors and factors*:

```{r}
typeof(gapminder)
```

When `length` gave us 6, it's because gapminder is built out of a list of 6
columns. To get the number of rows and columns in our dataset, try:

```{r}
nrow(gapminder)
ncol(gapminder)
```

Or, both at once:

```{r}
dim(gapminder)
```

We'll also likely want to know what the titles of all the columns are, so we can
ask for them later:

```{r}
colnames(gapminder)
```

At this stage, it's important to ask ourselves if the structure R is reporting
matches our intuition or expectations; do the basic data types reported for each
column make sense? If not, we need to sort any problems out now before they turn
into bad surprises down the road, using what we've learned about how R
interprets data, and the importance of *strict consistency* in how we record our
data.

Once we're happy that the data types and structures seem reasonable, it's time
to start digging into our data proper. Check out the first few lines:

```{r}
head(gapminder)
```

> ## Challenge 3
>
> It's good practice to also check the last few lines of your data and some in the middle. How would you do this?
>
> Searching for ones specifically in the middle isn't too hard but we could simply ask for a few lines at random. How would you code this?
>
> > ## Solution to Challenge 3
> > To check the last few lines it's relatively simple as R already has a function for this:
> > 
> > ~~~
> > tail(gapminder)
> > tail(gapminder, n = 15)
> > ~~~
> > {: .r}
> > 
> > What about a few arbitrary rows just for sanity (or insanity depending on your view)?
> > ## Tip: There are several ways to achieve this.
> > The solution here presents one form using nested functions. i.e. a function passed as an argument to another function. This might sound like a new concept but you are already using it in fact.
> > Remember my_dataframe[rows, cols] will print to screen your data frame with the number of rows and columns you asked for (although you might have asked for a range or named columns for example). How would you get the last row if you don't know how many rows your data frame has? R has a function for this. What about getting a (pseudorandom) sample? R also has a function for this.

To make sure our analysis is reproducible, we should put the code
into a script file so we can come back to it later.

> ## Challenge 4
>
> Go to file -> new file -> R script, and write an R script
> to load in the gapminder dataset. Put it in the `scripts/`
> directory and add it to version control.

> Run the script using the `source` function, using the file path

> ## Challenge 5
>
> Read the output of `str(gapminder)` again;
