```{r, include = FALSE}
source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
knitr_fig_path("07-")
# Silently load in the data so the rest of the lesson works
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv", header = TRUE)
# Silently set seed for random number generation, so we don't have to explain it
set.seed(10)
```

Often when we're coding we want to control the flow of our actions. This can be done
by setting actions to occur only if a condition or a set of conditions are met.
Alternatively, we can also set an action to occur a particular number of times.

There are several ways you can control flow in R.
For conditional statements, the most commonly used approaches are the constructs:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# if
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
}

# if ... else
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
} else {  # that is, if the condition is false,
  perform alternative action
}
```

Say, for example, that we want R to print a message if a variable `x` has a particular value:

```{r}
x <- 8

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
}

x
```

The print statement does not appear in the console because x is not greater than 10. To print a different message for numbers less than 10, we can add an `else` statement.

```{r}
x <- 8

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} else {
  print("x is less than 10")
}
```

You can also test multiple conditions by using `else if`.

```{r}
x <- 8

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} else if (x > 5) {
  print("x is greater than 5, but less than 10")
} else {
  print("x is less than 5")
}
```

**Important:** when R evaluates the condition inside `if()` statements, it is
looking for a logical element, i.e., `TRUE` or `FALSE`. This can cause some
headaches for beginners. For example:

```{r}
x  <-  4 == 3
if (x) {
  "4 equals 3"
} else {
  "4 does not equal 3"          
}
```

As we can see, the not equal message was printed because the vector x is `FALSE`

```{r}
x <- 4 == 3
x
```

Did anyone get a warning message like this?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
if (gapminder$year == 2012) {}
```

The `if()` function only accepts singular (of length 1) inputs, and therefore 
returns an error when you use it with a vector. The `if()` function will still 
run, but will only evaluate the condition in the first element of the vector. 
Therefore, to use the `if()` function, you need to make sure your input is 
singular (of length 1).

```

```{r}
y <- -3
ifelse(y < 0, "y is a negative number", "y is either positive or zero")

## Repeating operations

If you want to iterate over
a set of values, when the order of iteration is important, and perform the
same operation on each, a `for()` loop will do the job.
We saw `for()` loops in the shell lessons earlier. This is the most
flexible of looping operations, but therefore also the hardest to use
correctly. In general, the advice of many `R` users would be to learn about 
`for()` loops, but to avoid using `for()` loops unless the order of iteration is
important: i.e. the calculation at each iteration depends on the results of 
previous iterations. If the order of iteration is not important, then you 
should learn about vectorized alternatives, such as the `purrr` package, as they
pay off in computational efficiency. 

The basic structure of a `for()` loop is:  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for (iterator in set of values) {
  do a thing
}
```

For example:

```{r}
for (i in 1:10) {
  print(i)
}
```

The `1:10` bit creates a vector on the fly; you can iterate
over any other vector as well.

We can use a `for()` loop nested within another `for()` loop to iterate over two things at
oncech10pt5.

```{r}
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')) {
    print(paste(i,j))
  }
}
```

We notice in the output that when the first index (`i`) is set to 1, the second 
index (`j`) iterates through its full set of indices. Once the indices of `j` 
have been iterated through, then `i` is incremented. This process continues 
until the last index has been used for each `for()` loop.  

Rather than printing the results, we could write the loop output to a new object.

```{r}
output_vector <- c()
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')) {
    temp_output <- paste(i, j)
    output_vector <- c(output_vector, temp_output)
  }
}
output_vector
```

This approach can be useful, but 'growing your results' (building
the result object incrementally) is computationally inefficient, so avoid
it when you are iterating through a lot of values.

{: .callout}

A better way is to define your (empty) output object before filling in the values.
For this example, it looks more involved, but is still more efficient.

```{r}
output_matrix <- matrix(nrow = 5, ncol = 5)
j_vector <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in 1:5) {
    temp_j_value <- j_vector[j]
    temp_output <- paste(i, temp_j_value)
    output_matrix[i, j] <- temp_output
  }
}
output_vector2 <- as.vector(output_matrix)
output_vector2
```
