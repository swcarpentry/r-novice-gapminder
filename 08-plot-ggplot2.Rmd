Plotting our data is one of the best ways to
quickly explore it and the various relationships
between variables.

There are three main plotting systems in R,
the [base plotting system][base], the [lattice][lattice]
package, and the [ggplot2][ggplot2] package.

[base]: http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/
[lattice]: http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/trellis.html
[ggplot2]: http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/ggplot2.html

Today we'll be learning about the **ggplot2** package, because
it is the most effective for creating publication quality
graphics.

**ggplot2** is built on the grammar of graphics, the idea that any plot can be
expressed from the same set of components: a *data* set, a
*coordinate system*, and a set of *geoms*--the visual representation of data
points.

The key to understanding **ggplot2** is thinking about a figure in layers: just like
you might do in an image editing program like Photoshop, Illustrator, or
Inkscape.

Let's start off with an example:

```{r lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter, message=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
```

So the first thing we do is call the `ggplot` function. This function lets R
know that we're creating a new plot, and any of the arguments we give the
`ggplot` function are the *global* options for the plot: they apply to all
layers on the plot.

We've passed in two arguments to `ggplot`. First, we tell `ggplot` what data we
want to show on our figure, in this example the `gapminder` data we read in
earlier. For the second argument we passed in the `aes` function, which
tells `ggplot` how variables in the **data** map to *aesthetic* properties of
the figure, in this case the **x** and **y** locations. Here we told `ggplot` we
want to plot the `gdpPercap` column of the gapminder data frame on the x-axis, and
the `lifeExp` column on the y-axis. Notice that we didn't need to explicitly
pass `aes` these columns (e.g. `x = gapminder[, "gdpPercap"]`), this is because
`ggplot` is smart enough to know to look in the **data** for that column!

By itself, the call to `ggplot` isn't enough to draw a figure:

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
```

We need to tell `ggplot` how we want to visually represent the data, which we
do by adding a new **geom** layer. In our example, we used `geom_point`, which
tells `ggplot` we want to visually represent the relationship between **x** and
**y** as a scatterplot of points:

```{r lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter2}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Layers

Using a scatterplot probably isn't the best for visualising change over time.
Instead, let's tell `ggplot` to visualise the data as a line plot:

```{r lifeExp-line}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country, color=continent)) +
  geom_line()
```

Instead of adding a `geom_point` layer, we've added a `geom_line` layer. We've
added the **by** *aesthetic*, which tells `ggplot` to draw a line for each
country.

But what if we want to visualise both lines and points on the plot? We can
simply add another layer to the plot:

```{r lifeExp-line-point}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country, color=continent)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point()
```

It's important to note that each layer is drawn on top of the previous layer. In
this example, the points have been drawn *on top of* the lines. Here's a
demonstration:

```{r lifeExp-layer-example-1}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=continent)) + geom_point()
```

In this example, the *aesthetic* mapping of **color** has been moved from the
global plot options in `ggplot` to the `geom_line` layer so it no longer applies
to the points. Now we can clearly see that the points are drawn on top of the
lines.

## Transformations and statistics

Ggplot also makes it easy to overlay statistical models over the data. To
demonstrate we'll go back to our first example:

```{r lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter3, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_point()
```

Currently it's hard to see the relationship between the points due to some strong
outliers in GDP per capita. We can change the scale of units on the x axis using
the *scale* functions. These control the mapping between the data values and
visual values of an aesthetic.

```{r axis-scale}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_log10()
```

The `log10` function applied a transformation to the values of the `gdpPercap`
column before rendering them on the plot, so that each multiple of 10 now only
corresponds to an increase in 1 on the transformed scale, e.g. a GDP per capita
of 1,000 is now 3 on the y axis, a value of 10,000 corresponds to 4 on the y
axis and so on. This makes it easier to visualise the spread of data on the
x-axis.

We can fit a simple relationship to the data by adding another layer,
`geom_smooth`:

```{r lm-fit}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

We can make the line thicker by *setting* the **size** aesthetic in the
`geom_smooth` layer:

```{r lm-fit2}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + geom_smooth(method="lm", size=1.5)
```

There are two ways an *aesthetic* can be specified. Here we *set* the **size**
aesthetic by passing it as an argument to `geom_smooth`. Previously in the
lesson we've used the `aes` function to define a *mapping* between data
variables and their visual representation.

## Multi-panel figures

Earlier we visualised the change in life expectancy over time across all
countries in one plot. Alternatively, we can split this out over multiple panels
by adding a layer of **facet** panels. Focusing only on those countries with 
names that start with the letter "A" or "Z".

> ## Tip {.callout}
> 
> We start by subsetting the data.  We use the `substr` function to 
> pull out a part of a character string; in this case, the letters that occur 
> in positions `start` through `stop`, inclusive, of the `gapminder$country` 
> vector. The operator `%in%` allows us to make multiple comparisons rather 
> than write out long subsetting conditions (in this case, 
> `starts.with %in% c("A", "Z")` is equivalent to 
> `starts.with == "A" | starts.with == "Z"`)

```{r facet}
starts.with <- substr(gapminder$country, start = 1, stop = 1)
az.countries <- gapminder[starts.with %in% c("A", "Z"), ]
ggplot(data = az.countries, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap( ~ country)
```

The `facet_wrap` layer took a "formula" as its argument, denoted by the tilde
(~). This tells R to draw a panel for each unique value in the `country` column
of the `gapminder` dataset.

## Modifying text

To clean this figure up for a publication we need to change some of the text
elements. The x-axis is too cluttered, and the y axis should read
"Life expectancy", rather than the column name in the data frame.

We can do this by adding a couple of different layers. The **theme** layer
controls the axis text, and overall text size, and there are special layers
for changing the axis labels. To change the legend title, we need to use the
**scales** layer.

```{r theme}
ggplot(data = az.countries, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap( ~ country) +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Life expectancy") + ggtitle("Figure 1") +
  scale_colour_discrete(name="Continent") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(), axis.ticks.x=element_blank())
```


This is just a taste of what you can do with **ggplot2**. RStudio provides a
really useful [cheat sheet][cheat] of the different layers available, and more
extensive documentation is available on the [ggplot2 website][ggplot-doc].
Finally, if you have no idea how to change something, a quick google search will
usually send you to a relevant question and answer on Stack Overflow with reusable
code to modify!
