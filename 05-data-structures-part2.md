At this point, you've see it all - in the last lesson, we toured all the basic data types and data structures in R. Everything you do will be a manipulation of those tools. But a whole lot of the time, the star of the show is going to be the data.frame - that table that we started with that information from a CSV gets dumped into when we load it. In this lesson, we'll learn a few more things about working with data.frame.

We learned last time that the columns in a data.frame were vectors, so that our data are consistent in type throughout the column. As such, if we want to add a new column, we need to start by making a new vector:




~~~{.r}
newCol <- c(2,3,5,12)
cats
~~~



~~~{.output}
    coat weight likes_string
1 calico    2.1         TRUE
2  black    5.0        FALSE
3  tabby    3.2         TRUE

~~~

We can then add this as a column via:


~~~{.r}
cats <- cbind(cats,  newCol)
~~~



~~~{.error}
Error in data.frame(..., check.names = FALSE): arguments imply differing number of rows: 3, 4

~~~

Why didn't this work? Of course, R wants to see one element in our new column for every row in the table:


~~~{.r}
cats
~~~



~~~{.output}
    coat weight likes_string
1 calico    2.1         TRUE
2  black    5.0        FALSE
3  tabby    3.2         TRUE

~~~



~~~{.r}
newCol <- c(4,5,8)
cats <- cbind(cats, newCol)
cats
~~~



~~~{.output}
    coat weight likes_string newCol
1 calico    2.1         TRUE      4
2  black    5.0        FALSE      5
3  tabby    3.2         TRUE      8

~~~

Our new column has appeared, but it's got that ugly name at the top; let's give it something a little easier to understand:


~~~{.r}
names(cats)[4] <- 'age'
~~~

Now how about adding rows - in this case, we saw last time that the rows of a data.frame are made of lists:


~~~{.r}
newRow <- list("tortoiseshell", 3.3, TRUE, 9)
cats <- rbind(cats, newRow)
~~~



~~~{.error}
Warning in `[<-.factor`(`*tmp*`, ri, value = "tortoiseshell"): invalid
factor level, NA generated

~~~

Another thing to look out for has emerged - when R creates a factor, it only allows whatever is originally there when our data was first loaded, which was 'black', 'calico' and 'tabby' in our case. Anything new that doesn't fit into one of its categories is rejected as nonsense, until we explicitly add that as a *level* in the factor:


~~~{.r}
levels(cats$coat)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] "black"  "calico" "tabby" 

~~~



~~~{.r}
levels(cats$coat) <- c(levels(cats$coat), 'tortoiseshell')
cats <- rbind(cats, list("tortoiseshell", 3.3, TRUE, 9))
~~~

Alternatively, we can change a factor column to a character vector; we lose the handy categories of the factor, but can subsequently add any word we want to the column without babysitting the factor levels:


~~~{.r}
str(cats)
~~~



~~~{.output}
'data.frame':	5 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ coat        : Factor w/ 4 levels "black","calico",..: 2 1 3 NA 4
 $ weight      : num  2.1 5 3.2 3.3 3.3
 $ likes_string: logi  TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE
 $ age         : num  4 5 8 9 9

~~~



~~~{.r}
cats$coat <- as.character(cats$coat)
str(cats)
~~~



~~~{.output}
'data.frame':	5 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ coat        : chr  "calico" "black" "tabby" NA ...
 $ weight      : num  2.1 5 3.2 3.3 3.3
 $ likes_string: logi  TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE
 $ age         : num  4 5 8 9 9

~~~

We now know how to add rows and columns to our data.frame in R - but in our work we've accidentally added a garbage row. We can ask for a data.frame minus this offender:


~~~{.r}
cats[-4,]
~~~



~~~{.output}
           coat weight likes_string age
1        calico    2.1         TRUE   4
2         black    5.0        FALSE   5
3         tabby    3.2         TRUE   8
5 tortoiseshell    3.3         TRUE   9

~~~

Notice the comma with nothing after it to indicate we want to drop the entire fourth row. 
Alternatively, we can drop all rows with `NA` values:


~~~{.r}
na.omit(cats)
~~~



~~~{.output}
           coat weight likes_string age
1        calico    2.1         TRUE   4
2         black    5.0        FALSE   5
3         tabby    3.2         TRUE   8
5 tortoiseshell    3.3         TRUE   9

~~~

In either case, we need to reassign our variable to persist the changes:


~~~{.r}
cats <- na.omit(cats)
~~~

> ## Discussion 1 {.challenge} 
> What do you think
> ```
> cats$weight[4]
> ```
> will print at this point?
>

The key to remember when adding data to a data.frame is that *columns are vectors or factors, and rows are lists.*
We can also glue two dataframes together with `rbind`:


~~~{.r}
cats <- rbind(cats, cats)
cats
~~~



~~~{.output}
            coat weight likes_string age
1         calico    2.1         TRUE   4
2          black    5.0        FALSE   5
3          tabby    3.2         TRUE   8
5  tortoiseshell    3.3         TRUE   9
11        calico    2.1         TRUE   4
21         black    5.0        FALSE   5
31         tabby    3.2         TRUE   8
51 tortoiseshell    3.3         TRUE   9

~~~
But now the row names are unnecessarily complicated. We can ask R to re-name everything sequentially:


~~~{.r}
rownames(cats) <- NULL
cats
~~~



~~~{.output}
           coat weight likes_string age
1        calico    2.1         TRUE   4
2         black    5.0        FALSE   5
3         tabby    3.2         TRUE   8
4 tortoiseshell    3.3         TRUE   9
5        calico    2.1         TRUE   4
6         black    5.0        FALSE   5
7         tabby    3.2         TRUE   8
8 tortoiseshell    3.3         TRUE   9

So far, you've seen the basics of manipulating data.frames with our cat data; now, let's use those skills to digest a more realistic dataset. Lets read in the gapminder dataset that we downloaded previously:


~~~{.r}
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
~~~

Let's investigate gapminder a bit; the first thing we should always do is check out what the data looks like with `str`:


~~~{.r}
str(gapminder)
~~~



~~~{.output}
'data.frame':	1704 obs. of  6 variables:
 $ country  : Factor w/ 142 levels "Afghanistan",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ year     : int  1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 ...
 $ pop      : num  8425333 9240934 10267083 11537966 13079460 ...
 $ continent: Factor w/ 5 levels "Africa","Americas",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
 $ lifeExp  : num  28.8 30.3 32 34 36.1 ...
 $ gdpPercap: num  779 821 853 836 740 ...

~~~

We can also examine individual columns of the data.frame with our `typeof` function:


~~~{.r}
typeof(gapminder$year)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] "integer"

~~~



~~~{.r}
typeof(gapminder$lifeExp)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] "double"

~~~



~~~{.r}
typeof(gapminder$country)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] "integer"

~~~



~~~{.r}
str(gapminder$country)
~~~



~~~{.output}
 Factor w/ 142 levels "Afghanistan",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...

~~~

We can also interrogate the data.frame for information about its dimensions; remembering that `str(gapminder)` said there were 1704 observations of 6 variables in gapminder, what do you think the following will produce, and why?


~~~{.r}
length(gapminder)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] 6

~~~

A fair guess would have been to say that the length of a data.frame would be the number of rows it has (1704), but this is not the case; remember, a data.frame is a *list of vectors and factors*:


~~~{.r}
typeof(gapminder)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] "list"

~~~

When `length` gave us 6, it's because gapminder is built out of a list of 6 columns. To get the number of rows and columns in our dataset, try:


~~~{.r}
nrow(gapminder)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] 1704

~~~



~~~{.r}
ncol(gapminder)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] 6

~~~

Or, both at once:


~~~{.r}
dim(gapminder)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] 1704    6

~~~

We'll also likely want to know what the titles of all the columns are, so we can ask for them later:

~~~{.r}
colnames(gapminder)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] "country"   "year"      "pop"       "continent" "lifeExp"   "gdpPercap"

~~~

At this stage, it's important to ask ourselves if the structure R is reporting matches our intuition or expectations; do the basic data types reported for each column make sense? If not, we need to sort any problems out now before they turn into bad surprises down the road, using what we've learned about how R interprets data, and the importance of *strict consistency* in how we record our data.

Once we're happy that the data types and structures seem reasonable, it's time to start digging into our data proper. Check out the first few lines:


~~~{.r}
head(gapminder)
~~~



~~~{.output}
      country year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
1 Afghanistan 1952  8425333      Asia  28.801  779.4453
2 Afghanistan 1957  9240934      Asia  30.332  820.8530
3 Afghanistan 1962 10267083      Asia  31.997  853.1007
4 Afghanistan 1967 11537966      Asia  34.020  836.1971
5 Afghanistan 1972 13079460      Asia  36.088  739.9811
6 Afghanistan 1977 14880372      Asia  38.438  786.1134

~~~

To make sure our analysis is reproducible, we should put the code
into a script file so we can come back to it later.
