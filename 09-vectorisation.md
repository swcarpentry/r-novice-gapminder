One of the nice features of R is that most of its functions are vectorized,
that is the function will operate on all elements of a vector without
needing to loop through and act on each element one at a time. This makes
writing code more concise, easy to read, and less error prone.


~~~ {.r}
x <- 1:4
x * 2
~~~

~~~ {.output}
[1] 2 4 6 8
~~~

The multiplication happened to each element of the vector.

We can also add two vectors together:

~~~ {.r}
y <- 6:9
x + y
~~~

~~~ {.output}
[1]  7  9 11 13
~~~

Each element of `x` was added to its corresponding element of `y`:

~~~ {.output}
x:  1  2  3  4
    +  +  +  +
y:  6  7  8  9
---------------
    7  9 11 13

Comparison operators also apply element-wise, as we saw in the
subsetting lesson:

~~~ {.r}
x > 2
~~~

~~~ {.output}
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
~~~

Logical operations are also vectorised:

~~~ {.r}
a <- x > 3
~~~

~~~ {.r}
a
~~~

~~~ {.output}
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
~~~

> `all()` will return `TRUE` if *all* elements of a vector are `TRUE`

Many functions also operate on element-wise on vectors:

~~~ {.r}
x <- 1:4
log(x)
~~~

~~~ {.output}
[1] 0.0000000 0.6931472 1.0986123 1.3862944
~~~

Vectorised operations also work element wise on matrices:

~~~ {.r}
m <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3, ncol=4)
m * -1
~~~

~~~ {.output}
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]   -1   -4   -7  -10
[2,]   -2   -5   -8  -11
[3,]   -3   -6   -9  -12
~~~
