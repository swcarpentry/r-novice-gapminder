**Name of submitter**: Lindsay Coome  
**Lesson**: R for reproducible scientific analysis  
**Topic**: Data Structures  
**Concept being assessed**: Missing values and data types  

Exercise:
`NaN` is a type of missing value, and so `NaN` is a type of `NA`. However, not all `NA` are `NaN` - recall that `NA` can occur in any type of vector (in fact, `NA` values have the same class as the vector they belong to). Create a numeric vector with `NaN` and `NA` values, and use `is.na()` and `is.nan()` to test that the `NaN` values you created are `NA` but not vice versa.  
  
**Sample answer:**
```{r}
x <- c(NA, NA, 1, 10, NaN)
is.na(x)
is.nan(x)
```
