R for reproducible scientific analysis
===

Introduction to R for non-programmers using gapminder data.

The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to write modular code
and best practices for using R for data analysis. R is commonly used in many
scientific disciplines for statistical analysis and its array of third-party
packages. We find that many scientists who come to Software Carpentry workshops
use R and want to learn more. The emphasis of these materials is to give
attendees a strong foundation in the fundamentals of R, and to teach best
practices for scientific computing: breaking down analyses into modular units,
task automation, and encapsulation.

Note that this workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the
programming language R, and will not teach statistical analysis.

A variety of third party packages are used throughout this workshop. These
are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are
packages we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their
usability.

These lesson materials are adapted from the
[R-novice-inflammation](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation)
materials, which were translated from the Python materials, and materials from
our [R Data Carpentry materials used at the Sydney bootcamp last
year](https://dbarneche.github.io/2014-10-31-USyd/).

These lesson materials are designed to be run *after* both the Shell and Git
materials, and are built around the [Gapminder dataset](http://www.gapminder.org/).

## Contributing

Please see the current list of [issues][] for ideas for contributing to this
repository, and the [guidelines and instructions for contributing][contrib].

When editing topic pages, you should change the source R Markdown file.
Afterwards you can render the pages by running `make preview` from the base of
the repository. Building the rendered page with the Makefile requires
installing some dependencies first. In addition to the dependencies listed in
the [lesson template documentation][dependencies], you also need to install the
R package [knitr][].

Once you've made your edits and looked over the rendered html files, you should
 add, commit, and push **only the source R Markdown file(s)** to your fork, and
 then open a pull request. The repository  maintainers will run the html
 generation process once the pull request has been merged. You can learn more
 about the design of the build process [here][design].
