### SFU SWC workshop - introduction to R with the Gapminder dataset

1. Introduce R studio - 4 panels etc..

2. Introduce projects - way of keeping code, data, figures, analyses, tables etc. all together in one directory

  This avoids keeping scripts in one location away from text + data -  think of papers + projects as a single directory on your computer.

3. Talk about Git - but don't open Git. Focus on R.

4. Talk about file names - make them explicit and easy to read.

5. Before ANYTHING. Use R as a calculator in the console. Talk about shortcuts. Show example of missing + or missing ). You can use Esc to get out of a console problem. # is to comment - use frequently!

6. Read in data without assigning. PUT DATA IN THE PROJECT FOLDER.

#### Lesson plan

  ```

  gapminder<-read.csv("/Users/jpwrobinson/Desktop/SWC_SFU_R/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
  read.csv("gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")

  ```
1. How do we tell R to save objects?

  ```
  100
  a<-100
  a*22

  mass<-100
  masses<-c(10, 100, 50, 60)

  ```

2. Quick introduction to help in R

  ```
  ?read.csv
  ```

3. Explore gapminder

  ```
  ### Now we can use the same approach to save our gapminder data.
  gapminder<-read.csv("gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
  ## Appears in top right.
  ## How do we look through our data?
  head(gapminder)
  tail(gapminder)

  dim(gapminder)
  class(gapminder)
  str(gapminder)
  colnames(gapminder)
  ```

4. Different data structures in R.

  * Data frames are the most commonly used for reading in experimental data, remote sensing, observations etc.

  * Matrices might be more commonly used in mathematical modelling, or simulations.

  * Lists are useful for containing multiple data structures -  e.g. multiple data frames in a single object, or a data frame and a matrix.

5. Rows + columns

  ```
  gapminder[1,]
  gapminder[1,1]
  gapminder[10, 10]   ### What is this telling us?
  gapminder[10,6]
  ## Data frames also informative column names. We call these with $ signs
  gapminder$country
  ```

      **Socrative question**: What does gapminder$country[100] tell us?
      Correct answers:
      A) The country value in the 100th row of the gapminder dataframe
      B) Bangladesh

6. Simple functions

  ```
  ### Use ? to find out how to use these functions
  colnames(gapminder)
  max(gapminder$lifeExp)
  min(gapminder$pop)
  summary(gapminder$gdpPercap)
  unique(gapminder$country)

  ### levels for factors
  class(gapminder$country)
  levels(gapminder$country)
  ```

  Ok. All very well, but we really want to use R for more complex calculations. We could easily find the mean in excel.

  With data frames, you should develop your subsetting skills. A few simple commands go a long way in helping you understand your dataframe.

7. Logical commands in R

  A double equals (==) is a logical operator. It asks - is X exactly = to Y?

  ```
  gapminder$country=="United Kingdom"  ### what does this say?
  #  we want all of the records for UK = TRUE
  gapminder[gapminder$country=="United Kingdom",]

  ### also use which()
  gapminder[which(gapminder$country=="United Kingdom"),]
  ## also works for numbers...
  gapminder[gapminder$pop<100000,]
  ## we can combine commands...
  gapminder[gapminder$pop<100000 & gapminder$year==1952,]
  gapminder[gapminder$pop<500000 & gapminder$pop>10000,]
  ## What does the comma represent?

  ## We can now wrap our subset inside a function
  unique(gapminder$country[gapminder$pop<500000 & gapminder$pop>10000])
  ```

  **Socrative question**
  How would you estimate the mean population size across all of the Asian countries in gapminder?

  *COMMENT AFTER WORKSHOP: This was perhaps a little complicated. Maybe just use subset() instead - more intuitive for beginners.*

8. Aggregate

  Lets us calculate summary statistics on different sections of the data frame:
  ```
  ?aggregate

  aggregate(pop ~ country, gapminder, mean)
  mean_pop<-aggregate(cbind(pop, lifeExp) ~ country + continent, gapminder, mean)

  ## and by life exp...
  aggregate(lifeExp ~ continent + year, gapminder, mean)

  ## Now save our dataframe
  write.csv(mean_pop, file="mean_pop_bycountry_gapminder.csv")
  ```

  **Challenge**

  Which country has the maximum life expectancy between 1980-1989, in Asia?
  Answer: Japan. Get students to write this in the etherpad.

9. Plotting

  Very straightforward in base (default) R - just use plot().

  ```
  plot(mean_pop$pop)  ## this isn't particularly useful - just has order on the x axis

  plot(mean_pop$pop ~ mean_pop$country)  ## let's log population to deal with the large variability
  plot(log(mean_pop$pop) ~ mean_pop$country)  ## we can also boxplot - more informative?  
  plot(log(mean_pop$pop) ~ mean_pop$continent)

  ## return to the original dataset
  plot(gapminder$lifeExp ~ log(gapminder$pop))
  plot(gapminder$lifeExp ~ log(gapminder$pop), col=gapminder$continent)
  text(gapminder$lifeExp ~ log(gapminder$pop), labels=gapminder$country, col=as.numeric(gapminder$continent))
  ```


  ```
  ##### EXTRA WORK ###########################


  ## we can also sort our values...
  mean_pop_sorted<-mean_pop[order(mean_pop$pop),]
  head(mean_pop_sorted)
  tail(mean_pop_sorted)
  ## does it work??
  plot(mean_pop_sorted$pop ~ mean_pop_sorted$country)
  ## no. why not?

  levels(mean_pop_sorted$country)

  mean_pop_sorted$country<-reorder(mean_pop_sorted$country, mean_pop_sorted$pop)
  plot(mean_pop_sorted$pop ~ mean_pop_sorted$country) ## log it!
  plot(log(mean_pop_sorted$pop) ~ mean_pop_sorted$country, fill=mean_pop_sorted$continent)

  topten<-tail(mean_pop_sorted, 10)
  plot(log(topten$pop) ~ topten$country)

  ##Â NOW WHAT????
  levels(topten$country)
  topten$country<-droplevels(topten$country)
  plot(log(topten$pop) ~ topten$country)
  ### END WITH SOCRATIVE ON PLOTTING
