Often when we're coding we want to control the flow of our actions. This can be done
by setting actions to occur only if a condition or a set of conditions are met.
Alternatively, we can also set an action to occur a particular number of times.

There are several ways you can control flow in R.
For conditional statements, the most commonly used approaches are the constructs:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# if
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
}

# if ... else
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
} else {  # that is, if the condition is false,
  perform alternative action
}
```

Say, for example, that we want R to print a message if a variable `x` has a particular value:

```{r}
# sample a random number from a Poisson distribution
# with a mean (lambda) of 8

x <- rpois(1, lambda=8)

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
}

x
```

Note you may not get the same output as your neighbour because
you may be sampling different random numbers from the same distribution.

Let's set a seed so that we all generate the same 'pseudo-random'
number, and then print more information:

```{r}
x <- rpois(1, lambda=8)

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} else if (x > 5) {
  print("x is greater than 5")
} else {
  print("x is less than 5")
}
```

**Important:** when R evaluates the condition inside `if` statements, it is
looking for a logical element, i.e., `TRUE` or `FALSE`. This can cause some
headaches for beginners. For example:

```{r}
x  <-  4 == 3
if (x) {
  "4 equals 3"
}
```

As we can see, the message was not printed because the vector x is `FALSE`

```{r}
x <- 4 == 3
x
```

Did anyone get a warning message like this?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
if (gapminder$year == 2012) {}
```

If your condition evaluates to a vector with more than one logical element,
the function `if` will still run, but will only evaluate the condition in the first
element. Here you need to make sure your condition is of length 1.

## Repeating operations

 

If you want to iterate over
a set of values, when the order of iteration is important, and perform the
same operation on each, a `for` loop will do the job.
We saw `for` loops in the shell lessons earlier. This is the most
flexible of looping operations, but therefore also the hardest to use
correctly. Avoid using `for` loops unless the order of iteration is important:
i.e. the calculation at each iteration depends on the results of previous iterations.

The basic structure of a `for` loop is:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for(iterator in set of values){
  do a thing
}
```

For example:

```{r}
for(i in 1:10){
  print(i)
}
```

The `1:10` bit creates a vector on the fly; you can iterate
over any other vector as well.

Here is an example that iterates over a character vector:

```{r}
for(i in c("dog", "cat", "rat")){
      print(i)
}
```

We can use a `for` loop nested within another `for` loop to iterate over two things at
once.

```{r}
for (i in 1:5){
  for(j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')){
    print(paste(i,j))
  }
}
```

Rather than printing the results, we could write the loop output to a new object.

```{r}
output_vector <- c()
for (i in 1:5){
  for(j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')){
    temp_output <- paste(i, j)
    output_vector <- c(output_vector, temp_output)
  }
}
output_vector
```

This approach can be useful, but 'growing your results' (building
the result object incrementally) is computationally inefficient, so avoid
it when you are iterating through a lot of values.

A better way is to define your (empty) output object before filling in the values.
For this example, it looks more involved, but is still more efficient.

```{r}
output_matrix <- matrix(nrow=5, ncol=5)
j_vector <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
for (i in 1:5){
  for(j in 1:5){
    temp_j_value <- j_vector[j]
    temp_output <- paste(i, temp_j_value)
    output_matrix[i, j] <- temp_output
  }
}
output_vector2 <- as.vector(output_matrix)
output_vector2
```
