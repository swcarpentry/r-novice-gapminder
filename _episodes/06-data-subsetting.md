R has many powerful subset operators. Mastering them will allow you to
easily perform complex operations on any kind of dataset.

There are six different ways we can subset any kind of object, and three
different subsetting operators for the different data structures.

Let's start with the workhorse of R: a simple numeric vector.


~~~
x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
x
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  a   b   c   d   e 
5.4 6.2 7.1 4.8 7.5 
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Atomic vectors
>
> In R, simple vectors containing character strings, numbers, or logical values are called *atomic* vectors because they can't be further simplified.
{: .callout}

So now that we've created a dummy vector to play with, how do we get at its
contents?

## Accessing elements using their indices

To extract elements of a vector we can give their corresponding index, starting
from one:


~~~
x[1]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  a 
5.4 
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
x[4]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  d 
4.8 
~~~
{: .output}

It may look different, but the square brackets operator is a function. For vectors
(and matrices), it means "get me the nth element".

We can ask for multiple elements at once:


~~~
x[c(1, 3)]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  a   c 
5.4 7.1 
~~~
{: .output}

Or slices of the vector:


~~~
x[1:4]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  a   b   c   d 
5.4 6.2 7.1 4.8 
~~~
{: .output}

the `:` operator creates a sequence of numbers from the left element to the right.

~~~
1:4
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1 2 3 4
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
c(1, 2, 3, 4)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1 2 3 4
~~~
{: .output}


We can ask for the same element multiple times:


~~~
x[c(1,1,3)]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  a   a   c 
5.4 5.4 7.1 
~~~
{: .output}

If we ask for an index beyond the length of the vector, R will return a missing value:

~~~
x[6]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
<NA> 
  NA 
~~~
{: .output}

This is a vector of length one containing an `NA`, whose name is also `NA`.

If we ask for the 0th element, we get an empty vector:


~~~
x[0]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
named numeric(0)
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Vector numbering in R starts at 1
>
> In many programming languages (C and Python, for example), the first
> element of a vector has an index of 0. In R, the first element is 1.
{: .callout}

## Skipping and removing elements

If we use a negative number as the index of a vector, R will return
every element *except* for the one specified:


~~~
x[-2]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  a   c   d   e 
5.4 7.1 4.8 7.5 
~~~
{: .output}

We can skip multiple elements:


~~~
x[c(-1, -5)]  # or x[-c(1,5)]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  b   c   d 
6.2 7.1 4.8 
~~~
{: .output}

{: .callout}


To remove elements from a vector, we need to assign the result back
into the variable:


~~~
x <- x[-4]
x
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  a   b   c   e 
5.4 6.2 7.1 7.5 
~~~
{: .output}

## Subsetting by name

We can extract elements by using their name, instead of extracting by index:


~~~
x <- c(a=5.4, b=6.2, c=7.1, d=4.8, e=7.5) # we can name a vector 'on the fly'
x[c("a", "c")]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  a   c 
5.4 7.1 
~~~
{: .output}

This is usually a much more reliable way to subset objects: the
position of various elements can often change when chaining together
subsetting operations, but the names will always remain the same!

## Subsetting through other logical operations

We can also use any logical vector to subset:


~~~
x[c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  c   e 
7.1 7.5 
~~~
{: .output}

Since comparison operators (e.g. `>`, `<`, `==`) evaluate to logical vectors, we can also
use them to succinctly subset vectors: the following statement gives
the same result as the previous one.


~~~
x[x > 7]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  c   e 
7.1 7.5 
~~~
{: .output}

Breaking it down, this statement first evaluates `x>7`, generating
a logical vector `c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)`, and then
selects the elements of `x` corresponding to the `TRUE` values.

We can use `==` to mimic the previous method of indexing by name
(remember you have to use `==` rather than `=` for comparisons):


~~~
x[names(x) == "a"]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  a 
5.4 
~~~
{: .output}

>  * `|`, the "logical OR" operator: returns `TRUE`, if either the left or right

>

## Skipping named elements

Skipping or removing named elements is a little harder. If we try to skip one named element by negating the string, R complains (slightly obscurely) that it doesn't know how to take the negative of a string:


~~~
x <- c(a=5.4, b=6.2, c=7.1, d=4.8, e=7.5) # we start again by naming a vector 'on the fly'
x[-"a"]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in -"a": invalid argument to unary operator
~~~
{: .error}

However, we can use the `!=` (not-equals) operator to construct a logical vector that will do what we want:


~~~
x[names(x) != "a"]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  b   c   d   e 
6.2 7.1 4.8 7.5 
~~~
{: .output}

Skipping multiple named indices is a little bit harder still. Suppose we want to drop the `"a"` and `"c"` elements, so we try this:


~~~
x[names(x)!=c("a","c")]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Warning in names(x) != c("a", "c"): longer object length is not a multiple
of shorter object length
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
  b   c   d   e 
6.2 7.1 4.8 7.5 
~~~
{: .output}

R did *something*, but it gave us a warning that we ought to pay attention to - and it apparently *gave us the wrong answer* (the `"c"` element is still included in the vector)!

So what does `!=` actually do in this case? That's an excellent question.

### Recycling

Let's take a look at the comparison component of this code:


~~~
names(x) != c("a", "c")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Warning in names(x) != c("a", "c"): longer object length is not a multiple
of shorter object length
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
~~~
{: .output}

Why does R give `TRUE` as the third element of this vector, when `names(x)[3] != "c"` is obviously false?
When you use `!=`, R tries to compare each element
of the left argument with the corresponding element of its right
argument. What happens when you compare vectors of different lengths?

![Inequality testing](../fig/06-rmd-inequality.1.png)

When one vector is shorter than the other, it gets *recycled*:

![Inequality testing: results of recycling](../fig/06-rmd-inequality.2.png)

In this case R **repeats** `c("a", "c")` as many times as necessary to match `names(x)`, i.e. we get `c("a","c","a","c","a")`. Since the recycled `"a"`
doesn't match the third element of `names(x)`, the value of `!=` is `TRUE`.
Because in this case the longer vector length (5) isn't a multiple of the shorter vector length (2), R printed a warning message. If we had been unlucky and `names(x)` had contained six elements, R would *silently* have done the wrong thing (i.e., not what we intended it to do). This recycling rule can can introduce hard-to-find and subtle bugs!

The way to get R to do what we really want (match *each* element of the left argument with *all* of the elements of the right argument) it to use the `%in%` operator. The `%in%` operator goes through each element of its left argument, in this case the names of `x`, and asks, "Does this element occur in the second argument?". Here, since we want to *exclude* values, we also need a `!` operator to change "in" to "not in":


~~~
x[! names(x) %in% c("a","c") ]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  b   d   e 
6.2 4.8 7.5 
~~~

## Handling special values

At some point you will encounter functions in R that cannot handle missing, infinite,
or undefined data.

There are a number of special functions you can use to filter out this data:

 * `is.na` will return all positions in a vector, matrix, or data.frame
   containing `NA` (or `NaN`)
 * likewise, `is.nan`, and `is.infinite` will do the same for `NaN` and `Inf`.
 * `is.finite` will return all positions in a vector, matrix, or data.frame
   that do not contain `NA`, `NaN` or `Inf`.
 * `na.omit` will filter out all missing values from a vector

## Factor subsetting

Now that we've explored the different ways to subset vectors, how
do we subset the other data structures?

Factor subsetting works the same way as vector subsetting.


~~~
f <- factor(c("a", "a", "b", "c", "c", "d"))
f[f == "a"]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] a a
Levels: a b c d
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
f[f %in% c("b", "c")]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] b c c
Levels: a b c d
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
f[1:3]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] a a b
Levels: a b c d
~~~
{: .output}

Skipping elements will not remove the level
even if no more of that category exists in the factor:


~~~
f[-3]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] a a c c d
Levels: a b c d
~~~
{: .output}

## Matrix subsetting

Matrices are also subsetted using the `[` function. In this case
it takes two arguments: the first applying to the rows, the second
to its columns:


~~~
set.seed(1)
m <- matrix(rnorm(6*4), ncol=4, nrow=6)
m[3:4, c(3,1)]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
            [,1]       [,2]
[1,]  1.12493092 -0.8356286
[2,] -0.04493361  1.5952808
~~~
{: .output}

You can leave the first or second arguments blank to retrieve all the
rows or columns respectively:


~~~
m[, c(3,4)]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
            [,1]        [,2]
[1,] -0.62124058  0.82122120
[2,] -2.21469989  0.59390132
[3,]  1.12493092  0.91897737
[4,] -0.04493361  0.78213630
[5,] -0.01619026  0.07456498
[6,]  0.94383621 -1.98935170
~~~
{: .output}

If we only access one row or column, R will automatically convert the result
to a vector:


~~~
m[3,]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] -0.8356286  0.5757814  1.1249309  0.9189774
~~~
{: .output}

If you want to keep the output as a matrix, you need to specify a *third* argument;
`drop = FALSE`:


~~~
m[3, , drop=FALSE]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
           [,1]      [,2]     [,3]      [,4]
[1,] -0.8356286 0.5757814 1.124931 0.9189774
~~~
{: .output}

Unlike vectors, if we try to access a row or column outside of the matrix,
R will throw an error:


~~~
m[, c(3,6)]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in m[, c(3, 6)]: subscript out of bounds
~~~
{: .error}

> ## Tip: Higher dimensional arrays
>
> when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays, each argument to `[`
> corresponds to a dimension. For example, a 3D array, the first three
> arguments correspond to the rows, columns, and depth dimension.
>
{: .callout}

Because matrices are vectors, we can
also subset using only one argument:


~~~
m[5]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0.3295078
~~~
{: .output}


This usually isn't useful, and often confusing to read. However it is useful to note that matrices
are laid out in *column-major format* by default. That is the elements of the
vector are arranged column-wise:


~~~
matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    3    5
[2,]    2    4    6
~~~
{: .output}

If you wish to populate the matrix by row, use `byrow=TRUE`:


~~~
matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    2    3
[2,]    4    5    6
~~~
{: .output}

Matrices can also be subsetted using their rownames and column names
instead of their row and column indices.

## List subsetting

Now we'll introduce some new subsetting operators. There are three functions
used to subset lists. We've already seen these when learning about atomic vectors and matrices:  `[`, `[[`, and `$`.

Using `[` will always return a list. If you want to *subset* a list, but not
*extract* an element, then you will likely use `[`.


~~~
xlist <- list(a = "Software Carpentry", b = 1:10, data = head(iris))
xlist[1]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
$a
[1] "Software Carpentry"
~~~
{: .output}

This returns a *list with one element*.

We can subset elements of a list exactly the same way as atomic
vectors using `[`. Comparison operations however won't work as
they're not recursive, they will try to condition on the data structures
in each element of the list, not the individual elements within those
data structures.


~~~

$b

To extract individual elements of a list, you need to use the double-square
bracket function: `[[`.


~~~
xlist[[1]]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "Software Carpentry"
~~~
{: .output}

Notice that now the result is a vector, not a list.

You can't extract more than one element at once:


~~~
xlist[[1:2]]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in xlist[[1:2]]: subscript out of bounds
~~~
{: .error}

Nor use it to skip elements:


~~~
xlist[[-1]]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in xlist[[-1]]: attempt to select more than one element in get1index <real>
~~~
{: .error}

But you can use names to both subset and extract elements:


~~~
xlist[["a"]]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "Software Carpentry"
~~~
{: .output}

The `$` function is a shorthand way for extracting elements by name:


~~~
xlist$data
~~~
{: .language-r}

## Data frames

Remember the data frames are lists underneath the hood, so similar rules
apply. However they are also two dimensional objects:

`[` with one argument will act the same way as for lists, where each list
element corresponds to a column. The resulting object will be a data frame:


~~~
head(gapminder[3])
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
       pop
1  8425333
2  9240934
3 10267083
4 11537966
5 13079460
6 14880372
~~~
{: .output}

Similarly, `[[` will act to extract *a single column*:


~~~
head(gapminder[["lifeExp"]])
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 28.801 30.332 31.997 34.020 36.088 38.438
~~~
{: .output}

And `$` provides a convenient shorthand to extract columns by name:


~~~
head(gapminder$year)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977
~~~
{: .output}

With two arguments, `[` behaves the same way as for matrices:


~~~
gapminder[1:3,]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
      country year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
1 Afghanistan 1952  8425333      Asia  28.801  779.4453
2 Afghanistan 1957  9240934      Asia  30.332  820.8530
3 Afghanistan 1962 10267083      Asia  31.997  853.1007
~~~
{: .output}

If we subset a single row, the result will be a data frame (because
the elements are mixed types):


~~~
gapminder[3,]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
      country year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
3 Afghanistan 1962 10267083      Asia  31.997  853.1007
~~~
{: .output}

But for a single column the result will be a vector (this can
be changed with the third argument, `drop = FALSE`).
