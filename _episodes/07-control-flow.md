Often when we're coding we want to control the flow of our actions. This can be done
by setting actions to occur only if a condition or a set of conditions are met.
Alternatively, we can also set an action to occur a particular number of times.

There are several ways you can control flow in R.
For conditional statements, the most commonly used approaches are the constructs:


~~~
# if
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
}

# if ... else
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
} else {  # that is, if the condition is false,
  perform alternative action
}
~~~
{: .language-r}

Say, for example, that we want R to print a message if a variable `x` has a particular value:


~~~
x <- 8

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
}

x
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 8
~~~
{: .output}

The print statement does not appear in the console because x is not greater than 10. To print a different message for numbers less than 10, we can add an `else` statement.


~~~
x <- 8

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} else {
  print("x is less than 10")
}
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "x is less than 10"
~~~
{: .output}

You can also test multiple conditions by using `else if`.


~~~
x <- 8

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} else if (x > 5) {
  print("x is greater than 5, but less than 10")
} else {
  print("x is less than 5")
}
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "x is greater than 5, but less than 10"
~~~
{: .output}

**Important:** when R evaluates the condition inside `if()` statements, it is
looking for a logical element, i.e., `TRUE` or `FALSE`. This can cause some
headaches for beginners. For example:


~~~
x  <-  4 == 3
if (x) {
  "4 equals 3"
} else {
  "4 does not equal 3"          
}
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "4 does not equal 3"
~~~
{: .output}

As we can see, the not equal message was printed because the vector x is `FALSE`


~~~
x <- 4 == 3
x
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] FALSE
~~~
{: .output}

Did anyone get a warning message like this?


~~~
Warning in if (gapminder$year == 2012) {: the condition has length > 1 and
only the first element will be used
~~~
{: .error}

If your condition evaluates to a vector with more than one logical element,
the function `if()` will still run, but will only evaluate the condition in the first
element. Here you need to make sure your condition is of length 1.

## Repeating operations

If you want to iterate over
a set of values, when the order of iteration is important, and perform the
same operation on each, a `for()` loop will do the job.
We saw `for()` loops in the shell lessons earlier. This is the most
flexible of looping operations, but therefore also the hardest to use
correctly. Avoid using `for()` loops unless the order of iteration is important:
i.e. the calculation at each iteration depends on the results of previous iterations.

The basic structure of a `for()` loop is:


~~~
for(iterator in set of values){
  do a thing
}
~~~
{: .language-r}

For example:


~~~
for(i in 1:10){
  print(i)
}
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1
[1] 2
[1] 3
[1] 4
[1] 5
[1] 6
[1] 7
[1] 8
[1] 9
[1] 10
~~~
{: .output}

The `1:10` bit creates a vector on the fly; you can iterate
over any other vector as well.

We can use a `for()` loop nested within another `for()` loop to iterate over two things at
once.


~~~
for(i in 1:5){
  for(j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')){
    print(paste(i,j))
  }
}
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "1 a"
[1] "1 b"
[1] "1 c"
[1] "1 d"
[1] "1 e"
[1] "2 a"
[1] "2 b"
[1] "2 c"
[1] "2 d"
[1] "2 e"
[1] "3 a"
[1] "3 b"
[1] "3 c"
[1] "3 d"
[1] "3 e"
[1] "4 a"
[1] "4 b"
[1] "4 c"
[1] "4 d"
[1] "4 e"
[1] "5 a"
[1] "5 b"
[1] "5 c"
[1] "5 d"
[1] "5 e"
~~~
{: .output}

Rather than printing the results, we could write the loop output to a new object.


~~~
output_vector <- c()
for(i in 1:5){
  for(j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')){
    temp_output <- paste(i, j)
    output_vector <- c(output_vector, temp_output)
  }
}
output_vector
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 [1] "1 a" "1 b" "1 c" "1 d" "1 e" "2 a" "2 b" "2 c" "2 d" "2 e" "3 a"
[12] "3 b" "3 c" "3 d" "3 e" "4 a" "4 b" "4 c" "4 d" "4 e" "5 a" "5 b"
[23] "5 c" "5 d" "5 e"
~~~
{: .output}

This approach can be useful, but 'growing your results' (building
the result object incrementally) is computationally inefficient, so avoid
it when you are iterating through a lot of values.

{: .callout}

A better way is to define your (empty) output object before filling in the values.
For this example, it looks more involved, but is still more efficient.


~~~
output_matrix <- matrix(nrow=5, ncol=5)
j_vector <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
for(i in 1:5){
  for(j in 1:5){
    temp_j_value <- j_vector[j]
    temp_output <- paste(i, temp_j_value)
    output_matrix[i, j] <- temp_output
  }
}
output_vector2 <- as.vector(output_matrix)
output_vector2
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
 [1] "1 a" "2 a" "3 a" "4 a" "5 a" "1 b" "2 b" "3 b" "4 b" "5 b" "1 c"
[12] "2 c" "3 c" "4 c" "5 c" "1 d" "2 d" "3 d" "4 d" "5 d" "1 e" "2 e"
[23] "3 e" "4 e" "5 e"
